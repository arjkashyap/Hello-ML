# Machine Learning Basic Tutorial Using Python </h3>
### A repository for storing all the code I wrote as a beginner in Machine Learning.

<hr/>

This repo not only keeps track of my learning progress, but also lists various resources for learning ML which I use on daily basis.

## Info & Credits
Most of the code is written using Jupyter-notebook. This repository contains the following subdir: 
- basics: Writing general machine learning algorithms from scratch in python. The code is followed from a tutorial <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDfKTOs3Keq_kaG2P55YRn5v">Sentdex ML from scratch series</a>
- nnfs: Neural Networks from scratch series followed directly from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDcjD5BAw2DxE6OF2tius3V3">Sentdex NNFS series </a>
- notebooks: These are my jupyter notebooks where I wrote the code myself. These involve practise projects as well as some Kaggle challenges.
- reinforced-learning: Tutorial followed from an one of my favorite ML channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4UJ26WkceqONNF5S26OiVw"> Deeplizard </a>
